# Dotfiles Setup Script Improvement Tasks

## Medium Priority Tasks

### Task #7: Align package selections between macOS and Linux platforms
- Review package differences between packages-macos.txt and packages-linux.txt
- Add missing packages to achieve feature parity
- Document platform-specific alternatives where exact matches aren't available
- Ensure consistent development environment across both platforms

### Task #8: Move hardcoded values to external configuration files
- Create config.sh file for version numbers (NVM, Ruby, Node.js versions)
- Extract URLs and endpoints to configuration
- Make timeout values configurable
- Allow users to customize installation preferences
- Add environment variable overrides

### Task #9: Add verbosity levels and enhanced logging system
- Implement --verbose and --quiet flags
- Add debug logging level for troubleshooting
- Color-coded log levels (ERROR=red, WARN=yellow, INFO=green, DEBUG=blue)
- Log file output option for debugging
- Progress indicators for long operations

### Task #10: Add support for other Linux distributions (Fedora, Arch, CentOS)
- Extend detect_os() function for more distributions
- Add package installation logic for dnf (Fedora/RHEL)
- Add package installation logic for pacman (Arch)
- Add package installation logic for yum (CentOS)
- Create distribution-specific package files

### Task #11: Add dry-run mode for testing installations
- Implement --dry-run flag
- Show what would be installed without making changes
- Validate all prerequisites and dependencies
- Display download sizes and disk space requirements
- Allow users to preview changes before execution

### Task #12: Add validation mode to check system requirements
- Check minimum OS versions
- Verify available disk space
- Check for conflicting software
- Validate required system dependencies
- Pre-flight checks for common issues

## Low Priority Tasks

### Task #13: Refactor code to separate concerns and reduce coupling
- Split script into multiple modules (network.sh, packages.sh, languages.sh)
- Create shared utility functions
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Reduce global variable dependencies
- Improve code organization and maintainability

### Task #14: Add comprehensive troubleshooting guide to documentation
- Document common installation issues and solutions
- Add FAQ section to README
- Create troubleshooting scripts for common problems
- Add debugging commands and log analysis
- Include platform-specific gotchas

### Task #15: Add CI/CD pipeline for automated script validation
- Create GitHub Actions workflow
- Test script on multiple OS versions (Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, macOS 12, 13, 14)
- Test on different architectures (x86_64, ARM64)
- Validate package file syntax
- Run shellcheck and other linting tools
- Test rollback mechanisms
- Performance benchmarking

## Completed High Priority Tasks ✅

- ✅ Task #1: Add checksum verification for downloaded binaries
- ✅ Task #2: Remove curl | sh executions and add secure installation methods
- ✅ Task #3: Remove eval of arbitrary commands from package files
- ✅ Task #4: Add ARM64/Apple Silicon architecture detection and support
- ✅ Task #5: Add rollback and cleanup mechanisms for failed installations
- ✅ Task #6: Add network connectivity checks before downloads

## Notes

- All high-priority security and reliability improvements have been completed
- The script now has robust error handling, rollback mechanisms, and security features
- Medium and low priority tasks focus on user experience, platform support, and maintainability
- Tasks can be worked on independently in any order based on project priorities
